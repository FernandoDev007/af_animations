  ///
  /// Override this method to perform initialization that depends on the
  /// location at which this object was inserted into the tree (i.e., [context])
  /// or on the widget used to configure this object (i.e., [widget]).
  ///
  /// If a [State]'s [build] method depends on an object that can itself
  /// change state, for example a [ChangeNotifier] or [Stream], or some
  /// other object to which one can subscribe to receive notifications, then
  /// be sure to subscribe and unsubscribe properly in [initState],
  /// [didUpdateWidget], and [dispose]:
  ///
  ///  * In [initState], subscribe to the object.
  ///  * In [didUpdateWidget] unsubscribe from the old object and subscribe
  ///    to the new one if the updated widget configuration requires
  ///    replacing the object.

  /// following this method, and [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType] can

  /// method, as in `super.initState()`.

  /// method to notify this object about the change.
  ///
  /// This method is also called immediately after [initState]. It is safe to
  /// call [BuildContext.dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType] from this method.
  ///
  /// Subclasses rarely override this method because the framework always
  /// calls [build] after a dependency changes. Some subclasses do override

  /// The framework calls this method when this [State] object will never
  /// build again. After the framework calls [dispose], the [State] object is
  /// considered unmounted and the [mounted] property is false. It is an error
  /// to call [setState] at this point. This stage of the lifecycle is terminal:
  /// there is no way to remount a [State] object that has been disposed.
  ///
  /// Subclasses should override this method to release any resources retained
  /// by this object (e.g., stop any active animations).
  ///
  /// {@macro flutter.widgets.State.initState}

  /// Implementations of this method should end with a call to the inherited
  /// method, as in `super.dispose()`.

  /// ## Application shutdown
  ///
  /// This method is _not_ invoked when the application shuts down, because
  /// there is no way to predict when that will happen. For example, a user's
  /// battery could catch fire, or the user could drop the device into a
  /// swimming pool, or the operating system could unilaterally terminate the
  /// application process due to memory pressure.
  ///
  /// Applications are responsible for ensuring that they are well-behaved
  /// even in the face of a rapid unscheduled termination.
  ///
  /// To artificially cause the entire widget tree to be disposed, consider
  /// calling [runApp] with a widget such as [SizedBox.shrink].
  ///
  /// To listen for platform shutdown messages (and other lifecycle changes),
  /// consider the [AppLifecycleListener] API.

  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [deactivate], which is called prior to [dispose].
